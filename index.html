						<h1>Facilities</h1>
						<p>The site itself hosts a number of facilities aswell as being a short walk of Mablethorpe. Everything Mablethorpe has to offer is within a short distance of the chalet park and is great for exploring. The beach being 100m from the park over some sand dunes it's perfect for a relaxing beach holiday.</p>
